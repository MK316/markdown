[from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- **Markdown** "is a lightweight markup language **for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.** John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form."   
- It is widely used in **blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.**"    

- **GitHub favoured Markdown:** "Github had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009, adding support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting block content inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc. In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark."
